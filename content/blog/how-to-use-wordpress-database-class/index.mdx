WordPress features an object class with method functions for working with the database directly.
This database class is called `wpdb` and located in the `wp-includes/wp-db.php`.
Any time you are querying the WP database in PHP code, you should use the `wpdb` class.
The main reason for using this class is to allow WordPress to execute your queries in the safest way possible.

### Simple Database Queries.

When using the `wpdb` class, you must first define `$wpdb` as a global variable before it will be available for use.
To do so, just drop this line of code directly preceding any `$wpdb` function call:

```php
global $wpdb;
```

One of the most important functions in the `wpdb` class is the `prepare()` function.
This function is used for escaping variables passed to your SQL queries. This is critical step in preveting SQL injection attacks on your website.

> **Warning**: All queries should be passed through the prepare() function before being executed.

The `prepare()` function accepts a minimum of two parameters:
```php
$wpdb->prepare($query, $value1);
```
The `$query` parameter is the database query you want to run. The `$value1` parameter is the first
value you want to replace in the query. You can add additional value parameters as needed. Let's look an example:

``` php
global $wpdb;

$field_key = 'address';
$field_value = ' 1428 Elm St';
$wpdb->query($wpdb->prepare("INSERT INTO $wpdb->my_custom_table
(id, field_key, field_value) VALUES (%d, %s, %s) ", 1, $field_key, $field_value ) );

```

This example adds data into a none-default, custom table in WordPress that you would have
previously created. When using `prepare()`, make sure to replace any variables in your query with
`%s` for strings, %d for integers and %f for floats. Then list the variables as parameters
for the `prepare()` function in the exact same order. In the preceding example %d represents 1,
%s represents `$field_key`, and the second %s represents `$field_value`. Examples throughout this section
all use the `prepare()` function, which highlights its importance when working with database queries.

Notice that this example uses `$wpdb‐>my_custom_table` to reference the table in WordPress. This translates to
`wp_my_custom_table` if `wp_` is the table prefix. This is the proper way to determine the correct table
prefix when working with tables in the WordPress database.

The `$wpdb->query()` method is used to execute a simple query. This function is primarily used for `SELECT` statements.
Despite its name, it's not only for SQL `SELECT` queries. but will execute any SQL statement against the database.
Here's a basic query function example:

```php
global $wpdb;

$comment_count = $wpdb->query($wpdb->prepare(" DELETE FROM $wpdb->my_custom_table
 WHERE id = %d AND field_key= %d", 1, 'address'));

```

### Complex Database Operations

To retrieves an entire table row. You will want to use the [get_row()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/get_row/) function.

```php
global $wpdb;

$thepost = $wpdb->get_row( $wpdb->prepare(" SELECT * FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE ID= %d", 1));
echo $thepost->post_title;


```

The standard `SELECT` queries should use the [get_results()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/get_results/) function for retrieving multiple rows of data from the database.
The following function returns the SQL result data as an array:
```php
global $wpdb;

$liveposts = $wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT ID, post_title FROM
$wpdb->posts WHERE post_status = %d ", 'publish' ) );

foreach ( $liveposts as $livepost ) {
  echo '<p>' .$livepost->post_title. '</p>';
}
```

The WordPress database class also features specific functions for UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements.
These three functions eliminate the need for custom SQL queries because WordPress will create them for you
based on the values passed into the function. Here is how the insert() function is structured:

- Insert Function `$wpdb->insert( $table, $data, $format );`
```php

$wpdb->insert( $wpdb->postmeta, array(
        'post_id'
        'meta_key'
        'meta_value' => '1428 Elm St.'
    ), array(
        '%d', '%s', '%s'
    )
);
```
- Update Function `$wpdb->update( $table, $data, $where, $format, $where_format );`
```php

$wpdb->update( $wpdb->postmeta,
    array('meta_value' => '333 Wonderview Ave' ),
    array(
        'post_id' => '1', 'meta_key' => 'address'),
   )
   array( '%s' ),
   array( '%d','%s')
);
```
- Delete Function `$wpdb->delete( $table, $where, $where_format );`

```php

$wpdb->delete( $wpdb->postmeta,
    array(
        'post_id' => '1',
        'meta_key' => 'address'
    ),
    array( '%d','%s' )
);
```

The `insert()`, `update()`, and `delete()` functions shown do not need to be wrapped with the `prepare()` function.
These functions actually use the `prepare()` function after concatenating the query from the values passed to the functions.
This is a much easier method than manually creating your INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries in WordPress.

### Dealing with Errors

Any time you are working with queries, it's nice to see error messages. By default, if a custom query fails,
nothing is returned so it's hard to determine what is wrong with your query. The `wpdb` class provides function for
displaying MySql errors to the page. Here's an example of using these functions:

```php
$wpdb->show_errors();
$liveposts = $wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare("SELECT ID, post_title
FROM $wpdb->posts_FAKE WHERE post_status = 'publish'") );
$wpdb->print_error();
```

The `show_errors()` function must be called directly before you execute a query. The `print_error()` function must
 be called directly after you execute a query. If there are any errors in your SQL statement, the error messages
 are displayed. You can also call the `$wpdb‐>hide_errors()` function to hide all MySQL errors, or call the
 `$wpdb‐>flush()` function to delete the cached query results.

The database class contains additional variables that store information about WordPress queries.
Following is a list of some of the more common variables:

```php
var_dump( $wpdb->insert_id ); // Inserted ID after execute insert query
var_dump( $wpdb->num_queries ); // total number of queries ran
var_dump( $wpdb->num_rows ); // total number of rows returned by the last query var_dump( $wpdb->last_result ); // most recent query results
var_dump( $wpdb->last_query ); // most recent query executed
var_dump( $wpdb->col_info ); // column information for the most recent query
```

Another very powerful database variable is the $queries variable. This stores all of the queries run by WordPress.
 To enable this variable, you must first set the constant value SAVEQUERIES to true in your wp‐config.php file.
 This tells WordPress to store all of the queries executed on each page load in the $queries variable.
  First drop this line of code in your wp‐config.php file:

`define( 'SAVEQUERIES', true );`

Now all queries will be stored in the $queries variable. You can display all of the query information like so:

`var_dump( $wpdb->queries ); // displays all queries executed during page load`

## Conclusion

The database query class is a major asset when working with the WordPress database directly,
as you will see when developing a plugin or building a more complex Loop. All of the previously mentioned database
 class functions use specific escaping techniques to verify that your queries are executed in the safest manner possible.

The query preparation and escaping functions ensure that inputs don’t become SQL functions, no matter how craftily
 they’re set up. It is essential that you follow these methods for querying data to ensure your website is the most
  efficient and uses the safest techniques possible.
